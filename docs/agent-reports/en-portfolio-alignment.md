# EN-PORTFOLIO-001: Portfolio Page Alignment Report

**Assignment:** Align local English portfolio page with live site
- **Local URL:** http://localhost:8001/en/portfolio/
- **Live URL:** https://innoledge.com/our-portfolio/
- **Date:** June 24, 2025
- **Agent:** EN-PORTFOLIO-001

## Initial Analysis

### Major Differences Identified

#### 1. **Content Structure Mismatch**
- **Local:** Shows service category icons (Marketing, Sourcing, Investment, Regulatory Affairs, Business Consultancy, Distribution)
- **Live:** Shows detailed product portfolio with categories:
  - Medicines (with detailed subcategories)
  - Cosmetics
  - Health Food Supplements
  - Medical Devices
  - Animal Health

#### 2. **Header Section**
- **Local:** "OUR COMPANY" header with blue background image
- **Live:** "OUR PORTFOLIO" header with orange background

#### 3. **Content Organization**
- **Local:** Brief company description with offices information
- **Live:** Detailed product listings with images and comprehensive categorization

#### 4. **Visual Elements**
- **Local:** Missing product images that appear on live site
- **Live:** Rich visual content with product photos and medical imagery

## Root Cause Analysis

The local version appears to be using incorrect content - it's showing a general company/services overview instead of the actual portfolio content. The local `/en/portfolio/` directory likely contains outdated or incorrect HTML files.

## Action Plan

1. **Investigate local portfolio file structure**
2. **Compare with live site content source**
3. **Replace local content with correct portfolio structure**
4. **Test all sections and functionality**
5. **Verify visual alignment**

## Files to Investigate
- `/en/portfolio/index.html`
- Related CSS and asset files
- Compare with live site structure

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: File Structure Analysis
**COMPLETED** - Issue identified:

The local `/en/portfolio/index.html` file contains **incorrect content**. Instead of showing portfolio products, it displays:
- Services grid (Marketing, Sourcing, Investment, Regulatory Affairs, Business Consultancy, Distribution)
- "OUR COMPANY" section with company description
- This is essentially the services page content, not portfolio content

**Evidence:**
- Server logs show services-related assets being loaded (`services/marketing-edited.jpg`, etc.)
- Screenshot shows services grid instead of product categories
- File appears to have been corrupted or contains wrong content template

**Root Cause:** The local portfolio HTML file has wrong content structure

### Phase 2: Content Replacement
**COMPLETED** - Portfolio content successfully replaced:

✅ **Achievements:**
- Replaced entire portfolio HTML content with correct structure
- Added proper "OUR PORTFOLIO" orange banner header
- Implemented all 5 product categories exactly matching live site:
  - Medicines (with 14 detailed subcategories)
  - Cosmetics
  - Health Food Supplements  
  - Medical Devices
  - Animal Health
- Added proper sidebar with Related Links and partner logos
- Maintained responsive layout structure

⚠️ **Remaining Issue:**
- Product images are missing (404 errors) - need to source/create appropriate images
