**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Agent:** ZH-ABOUT-001  
**Status:** CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The live Chinese about page is NOT functioning correctly and is showing completely wrong content. The local version has the correct Chinese about page structure, but the live site has serious routing/deployment issues.

## Detailed Analysis

### Local Version (http://localhost:8001/zh/about/)
✅ **STATUS: CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION**

**Content Structure:**
- **Page Title:** 公司简介 (Company Profile)
- **Header:** Proper Chinese navigation with Innoledge logo
- **Main Content:** Bruno Leraillez profile with Chinese translation
- **Contact Information:** Complete Chinese contact details
- **Partner Logos:** All partner logos displaying correctly
- **Footer:** Proper Chinese footer with company information

**Technical Details:**
- HTML structure is correct and complete
- Proper meta tags with Chinese descriptions
- Language alternates properly configured
- CSS styling applied correctly
- All images loading properly

### Live Version (https://innoledge.com/zh/about/)
❌ **STATUS: CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE**

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Wrong Content Served:** The URL `https://innoledge.com/zh/about/` shows completely different content:
   - Initially redirected to TR Digital Services website
   - When accessed via proper navigation, shows Contact Us page in English
   - No Chinese about page content visible

2. **Routing Problems:** 
   - Chinese URLs use encoded characters: `%e5%85%ac%e5%8f%b8%e7%ae%80%e4%bb%8b`
   - Clicking Chinese "公司简介" link leads to contact page, not about page
   - URL structure mismatch between expected and actual

3. **Language Issues:**
   - Page shows English content instead of Chinese
   - Meta tags indicate English language (`lang="en-GB"`)
   - No Chinese translation visible

## Visual Comparison

### Screenshots Captured:
1. **local_zh_about_full.png** - Local Chinese about page (correct)
2. **live_zh_about_correct.png** - Live site Chinese homepage (working)
3. **live_about_actual_content.png** - Live site serving wrong content
4. **live_zh_about_bottom_section.png** - Live site showing contact content

### Key Differences:
- **Local:** Shows Bruno Leraillez profile with Chinese biography
- **Live:** Shows contact form and company address information
- **Expected:** Both should show identical about page content

## Content Verification

### Chinese Translations (Local Version - Correct):
- **Company Name:** 乐奇国际有限公司 (Innoledge International Limited)
- **Page Title:** 公司简介 (Company Profile)
- **CEO Title:** Bruno Leraillez 博士, 创始人兼首席执行官
- **Biography:** Complete Chinese translation of Bruno's profile
- **Contact Details:** All properly translated

### Missing Content (Live Version):
- No Bruno Leraillez profile
- No Chinese company biography
- No about page specific content
- Wrong page entirely being served

## Technical Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. **Fix Live Site Routing:**
   - Chinese about page URL is not serving correct content
   - Need to deploy the correct Chinese about page HTML
   - Fix URL encoding issues for Chinese paths

2. **Deployment Issues:**
   - Local version is correctly implemented
   - Need to ensure local version is properly deployed to live server
   - Verify server configuration for Chinese character handling

3. **URL Structure:**
   - Local uses: `/zh/about/`
   - Live should use: `/zh/about/` (not encoded Chinese characters)
   - Ensure consistent URL structure across all languages

### Specific Steps:

1. **Deploy Correct File:**
   ```
   Source: /Users/philippebarthelemy/dev/innoledge/innoledge/zh/about/index.html
   Target: Live server Chinese about page
   ```

2. **Verify Server Configuration:**
   - Ensure Chinese character support
   - Check .htaccess or server routing rules
   - Test URL redirects and character encoding

3. **Update Live Site:**
   - Replace incorrect content with local version
   - Test all Chinese navigation links
   - Verify meta tags and language attributes

## Conclusion

**STATUS:** The local Chinese about page is perfectly implemented and ready for deployment. The live site has critical routing issues that prevent the Chinese about page from displaying correctly.

**PRIORITY:** HIGH - The live Chinese about page is completely non-functional and needs immediate deployment of the correct content.

**NEXT STEPS:** Deploy the local version to the live server and fix the routing configuration to serve Chinese content properly.
