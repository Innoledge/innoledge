# Chinese Homepage Alignment Report (ZH-HOME-001)

**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Agent:** ZH-HOME-001  
**Assignment:** Chinese homepage alignment between localhost:8001/zh/ and live site innoledge.com/zh/

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of both Chinese homepages, I've identified significant structural differences between the local development environment and the live site. The local version correctly displays a services-focused homepage while the live site shows an about page layout.

## Key Findings

### 1. Page Structure Differences

**Local Environment (localhost:8001/zh/):**
- ✅ Displays proper homepage with 6-service grid layout
- ✅ Services prominently featured as main content
- ✅ Company information section below services
- ✅ Complete navigation structure

**Live Site (innoledge.com/zh/):**
- ❌ Shows company introduction page (公司介绍) instead of homepage
- ❌ Services reduced to small icons at top
- ❌ Missing prominent services grid display
- ❌ Different layout structure entirely

### 2. Services Grid Analysis

**Local Services Grid (CORRECT):**
1. **市场营销** (Marketing) - Full service card with image
2. **采购** (Sourcing) - Full service card with image  
3. **投资** (Investment) - Full service card with image
4. **注册事务** (Regulatory Affairs) - Full service card with image
5. **商务咨询** (Business Consultancy) - Full service card with image
6. **分布** (Distribution) - Full service card with image

**Live Site Services (INCORRECT):**
- Only shows small service icons at the top
- No prominent services grid display
- Services not effectively showcased

### 3. Navigation Elements

**Both sites have consistent:**
- ✅ Chinese language navigation (主页, 服务, 我们的产品, 公司简介, 联系我们)
- ✅ Language switcher functionality (中文 dropdown)
- ✅ Partner links sidebar ("相关链接")
- ✅ Contact information in footer

### 4. Chinese Content Accuracy

**Translation Quality:**
- ✅ All Chinese translations are accurate
- ✅ Character encoding displays correctly
- ✅ Navigation terms properly localized
- ✅ Service names correctly translated:
  - 市场营销 (Marketing)
  - 采购 (Sourcing/Procurement)
  - 投资 (Investment)
  - 注册事务 (Regulatory Affairs)
  - 商务咨询 (Business Consultancy)
  - 分布 (Distribution)

### 5. Visual Design Consistency

**Local Environment:**
- ✅ Services grid with professional layout
- ✅ Consistent branding and colors
- ✅ Proper image sizing and spacing
- ✅ Clean, modern design

**Live Site Issues:**
- ❌ Different layout structure
- ❌ Services not prominently displayed
- ❌ Missing visual impact of services grid

## Technical Analysis

### Homepage File Structure (Local)
The local `zh/index.html` file contains the correct structure:
- Services grid with 6 service items (lines 126-221)
- Proper Chinese labels and navigation
- Company section with video and content
- Complete sidebar with partner links

### Deployment Issue
The live site appears to be serving a different page or has incorrect routing that displays the about page content instead of the homepage services grid.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Deploy Local Version to Live Site**
   - The local Chinese homepage is correctly structured and should be deployed
   - Verify that `/zh/index.html` is properly uploaded to live server

2. **Server Configuration Check**
   - Verify routing configuration for `/zh/` endpoint
   - Ensure Chinese index file is being served correctly

3. **Content Management**
   - Confirm that the services grid images are uploaded to live server
   - Verify all service page links function correctly

### Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Services grid displays all 6 services prominently
- [ ] All Chinese translations display correctly
- [ ] Navigation links work properly
- [ ] Language switcher functions correctly
- [ ] Partner links sidebar appears on right
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained
- [ ] Service page navigation works

## Conclusion

The local Chinese homepage implementation is **CORRECT** and ready for deployment. The live site currently shows incorrect content (about page instead of homepage). The local version successfully displays all 6 services in Chinese with proper navigation and layout structure.

**Status:** Local implementation complete, live deployment required
**Priority:** High - Homepage is crucial for user experience
**Next Steps:** Deploy local zh/index.html to live environment
