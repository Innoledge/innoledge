### Root Cause Analysis
**IDENTIFIED**: The localhost French site has multiple homepage files with conflicting content:

1. **`/fr/index.html`** - Contains correct modern homepage content with services grid (matches live site structure)
2. **`/fr/page-daccueil/index.html`** - Contains old WordPress export with broken wp-content links
3. **Server routing issue**: `/fr/` returns 404, but `/fr/index.html` shows contact page content instead of homepage
4. **File content mismatch**: The `/fr/index.html` file content doesn't match what's being served

**Critical Issue**: Server is not properly serving the French homepage at `/fr/` - returns 404 error page instead.

## Phase 2: Iterative Fixes
### Change #1: Server Caching Issue Resolution
- **Issue**: French homepage returning 404 or displaying wrong content due to browser/server caching
- **Fix Applied**: 
  1. Restarted browser session with cache-clearing flags
  2. Server was already serving correct content (verified with curl)
  3. Browser cache was preventing proper display
- **Files Modified**: None - issue was client-side caching
- **Test Result**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL - All 6 services now displaying correctly
- **Status**: COMPLETED

### Verification Results
- ✅ **Services Grid**: All 6 services displayed correctly in French (Marketing, Sourcing, Investissement, Affaires Réglementaires, Conseil en Affaires, Distribution)
